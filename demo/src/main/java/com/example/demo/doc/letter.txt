Dear John
   I am very glad to hear that you have passed the entrance examination and been accepted by Yale University.
I feel  very proud of you and I believe you really deserve the honor since you have been working so hard.As you
have mentioned in the letter.There are both some similarities and differences between the college life and high
school life.On the one hand.



Dear xxx:
    I would like to convey my heartfelt thanks to you for your kindness to receive me when
I participated in an exchange program in USA.
    Your generous help made it possible that i had a very pleasant stay and a chance to know
American cultures better.Besides,I think it is honor for me to make friends with you and I will
cherish the goodwill you showed to me wherever I go.I do hope that you will visit China one day.
so that I could have the opportunity to reply your kindness and refresh our friendship.
    I feel obliged to thank you again.
                                            Sincerely yours,
                                            xxx xxx
